## Professional Self-Assessment
TO-DO

## Artifact
Final submission for the class CS 260 - Data Structures and Algorithms, submitted on August, 2020. The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/zambiazzi89/CS260).

### Description
The project consisted of C++ programs store and perform operations on a CSV file that contained records of bids. The data structures used in this project were linked list, vector, hash table, and binary search tree. Furthermore, algorithms such as binary tree in-order traversal and vector quick sort were also implemented. Lastly, the program displayed the time elapsed in each operation.

## Enhancements
The enhanced full-stack application can be found [here](https://github.com/zambiazzi89/CS499).

### Justification
I chose this artifact for the three categories below because it permitted multiple types of enhancements to showcase different skills relevant to each category. My plan to enhance ths artifact consisted of translating it from C++ to JavaScript, implementing additional algorithms, and creating a server and database to store the dataset and allow for persistent changes.
- **Software Design and Engineering:** To translate my project from C++ to JavaScript, I created a web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. The application implements all the data structures and algorithms from my initial project, the only difference being the use of arrays instead of vectors, since, unlike C++, JavaScript does not have built-in vectors. This enhancement showcases my skills and abilities to translate, design and engineer a front-end application using different languages and frameworks.
- **Algorithm and Data Structures:** I expanded the algorithms in the original application by implementing a merge sort functionality for the array, a reverse list functionality for the linked list, a button to change the hash salt used in the hash table, and the pre-, in-, and post-order traversals for the binary search tree. This enhancement showcases my knowledge of data structures and algorithms and my skills and abilities to expand their complexities.
- **Database:** Since the original artifact did not contain a database, it would allow me to implement a full-stack application from scratch. The artifact was improved by making it possible for users to access the dataset and make persistent changes to it. This enhancement showcases my skills and abilities to create a full-stack application using a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React.js, Node.js) stack.

### Objectives Met
With the enhancements listed above, the objectives planned in the beginning of this course were met.
- **Software Design and Engineering:** As planned, the application was successfully translated from C++ to JavaScript. Additionally, I used other languages and frameworks to build a complete user interface to improve user experience.
- **Algorithm and Data Structures:** I expanded each of the data structures' functionalities by implementing at least one additional algorithm. The only difference from my initial plan was to implement a functionality to modify the hash salt used in the hash table. I opted for this functionality because it shows the importance of choosing efficient hash salt values when implementing the hash algorithm to calculate the keys of the elements in the hash table.
- **Database:** I created a database for the dataset containing the information of bids used in the original project. However, instead of focusing on storing the time elapsed for the data structure algorithms, as I originally proposed in the beginning of this course, I decided to focus on performing CRUD operations on the database. I made this change because it ensured that the most common operations used in REST APIs were implemented.

### Reflection
- **Software Design and Engineering:** The first challenge I faced when working on this project was defining the design and structure of the application. I already had experience in using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js in previous projects. However, working on this capstone helped me practice and improve my skills in these languages. For instance, it required me to learn new concepts regarding CSS transitions, JavaScript asynchronous functions, and React.js Hooks.
- **Algorithm and Data Structures:** This project also helped me differentiate the strategies used in the implementation of algorithms according to the language being used. For instance, unliked C++, JavaScript does not have pointers. Therefore, some changes might have to be made to the logic of algorithms due to the difference between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference operations.
- **Database:** There were multiple obstacles I faced when implementing the backend of this application and its communication with the frontend. These challenges include handling asynchronous function calls and catching API errors. I also had to relearn how to resolve CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors when fetching data from the backend. These challenges were valuable to my future career as a software developer, as they strengthen my problem-solving skills and are examples of situations that can occur in real scenarios.

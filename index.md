## Professional Self-Assessment
TO-DO

## Artifact
Final submission for the class CS 260 - Data Structures and Algorithms, submitted on August, 2020. The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/zambiazzi89/CS260).

### Description
The project consisted of C++ programs store and perform operations on a CSV file that contained records of bids. The data structures used in this project were linked lists, vectors, hash table, and binary search tree. While algorithms such as binary tree in-order traversal and vector quick sort were also implemented.

## Enhancements

### Justification
- Software Design and Engineering:
- Algorithm and Data Structures:
- Database:
The original artifact did not contain a database, and I selected this item because it would allow me to implement a full-stack application from scratch. The artifact was improved by making it possible for users to access the dataset and make persistent changes to it. This enhancement showcases my skills and abilities to create a full-stack application using a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React.js, Node.js) stack.

### Objectives Met
- Software Design and Engineering:
- Algorithm and Data Structures:
- Database:
With these enhancements, I met most of the course objectives I planned in Module One. As planned, I created a database for the dataset containing the information of bids used in the original project. However, instead of focusing on storing the time elapsed for the data structure algorithms, as I originally proposed in Milestone One, I decided to focus on performing CRUD operations on the database. I made this change because it ensured that the most common operations used in REST APIs were implemented.

### Reflection
- Software Design and Engineering:
- Algorithm and Data Structures:
- Database:
There were multiple obstacles I faced when implementing the backend of this application and its communication with the frontend. These challenges include handling asynchronous function calls and catching API errors. I also had to relearn how to resolve CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors when fetching data from the backend. These challenges were valuable to my future career as a software developer, as they strengthen my problem-solving skills and are examples of situations that can occur in real scenarios.
